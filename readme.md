# FSA Technical Interview Prep

This repo contains the Fullstack senior phase technical interview prep materials, notably including the current canonical REACTO curriculum (see the `/algorithms` folder).

The technical interview prep curriculum is in this format so that we can use git for source control.

# Sharing the Interview materials with Students

To share problems with students in advance of their REACTO sessions, the current practice is for fellows to create a Gist with the relevant materials and share it.

For problems that have been converted into the remark slides, you can use either [remarkise][remarkise] or [fs-present][fs-present] to present them.

[remarkise]: https://remarkjs.com/remarkise
[fs-present]: https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/fs-present
