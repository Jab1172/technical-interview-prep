# Data Structures

## Current Questions

### DS vs ADT

What are the differences between Data Structures (DS) and Abstract Data Types
(ADT)? List several ADTs as well as some DSs used to implement them.

### Top ten list

Say you have an e-commerce site and want to implement a "Top ten" list which
lists the top ten items by volume sold per day. Storing a sorted array of all
items is impractical. What ADT would be useful in this case? How would you
implement this top ten list?

### Autocomplete

Which ADT would you use to implement autocomplete suggestions? Explain why.

## Extra Questions

- Describe the tradeoffs in space and time complexity between using a (true)
  array and a linked list.
- What is the time complexity (Big O) of finding a value in a binary search
  tree? Explain WHY that is the case and what it means.
- What are collisions in a hash table? Name a couple ways that we can resolve
  these collisions. How can we avoid collisions in the first place?
- Design the database schema for an app or service you use frequently. Pay
  particular attention to how tables are associated (one-to-one, one-to-many,
  many-to-many) and think about data types. The instructor or fellow should
  demonstrate doing so with a simple schema (3-5 tables) on a whiteboard before
  having students do so on their own.
