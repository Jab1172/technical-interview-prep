# Big O

## Current Questions

### What is Big O?

What is Big O notation? Explain big O notation, its definition and usage in a
sentence or two.

### What is the order of complexities?

Order the following from decreasing to increasing complexity and justify your
order: `O(n!), O(n), O(n log n), O(log n) O(2**n), O(n**2), O(1)`.

### Examples of solutions by a given complexity

Find an example problem with a solution that has a given time/space complexity,
preferably one where that complexity is required. For example, sorting can be
solved with bubble sort in `O(n**2)` time, but we know sorting can be solved in
`O(n log n)`. Find a problem whose best solution, as far as you know, runs in
`O(n**2)`. One solution: all possible sums of numbers from two arrays. For this
question use one of the following complexities:

    1, log n, n, n log n, n**2, 2**n, n!

#### Potential answers

See also: Wikipedia's table of common [time complexities][time-complexities].

- `O(1)`: Finding the median value in a list of sorted numbers
- `O(log n)`: Binary search
- `O(n)`: Finding the smallest or largest item in an unsorted array
- `O(n log n)`: Fastest possible comparison sort
- `O(n**2)`: Comparison sort w/ constant space
- `O(2**n)`: Solving the traveling salesman problem (w/ dynamic programming)
- `O(n!)`: Generating all permutations of a string

## Extra Questions

 - Describe two array sorting algorithms and their Big O notation.
 - How would you go about determining the Big O of a given algorithm?
    - Answer should include methodical approaches to determining Big O (i.e. is
      input size irrelevant to time, do you have to go through entire list, does
      algorithmâ€™s processing time increase at slower rate than size of data set,
      are there nested loops, etc.), dropping less significant terms, ignoring
      multiplicative constants.

- Explain the difference between time complexity and space complexity and when
    you would be concerned about one over the other.
